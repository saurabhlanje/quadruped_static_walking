# quadruped_static_walking
Here I am gathering all the details required to make a quadruped robot with static walking gait
Target is to make something like this https://www.instructables.com/ARDUINO-SPIDER-ROBOT-QUADRUPED/
but with detailed understanding of gait generation and quadruped locomotion stability

Useful resources
