# quadruped_static_walking
Here I am gathering all the details required to make a quadruped robot with static walking gait
Target is to make something like this https://www.instructables.com/ARDUINO-SPIDER-ROBOT-QUADRUPED/
but with detailed understanding of gait generation and quadruped locomotion stability
Desired features are as follows
1) Mechanical structure taken from instructables mentioned above
2) Control system is to be developed from scratch
3) ESP32 based control electronics
4) MPU9250 for realtime attitude estimation
5) Integrated with ROS for implementation of complicated gait generation algorithms

Useful resources
1) Book https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Quadrupedal_Locomotion/3ZlDAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0
